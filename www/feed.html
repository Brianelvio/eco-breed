Hello World, my name is dev [and i'm peaches] **and we're the creators of the eco project for second life.**



our goal, when we started this project a year ago, was simple: 

develop a powerful, yet easy-to-use web-based toolkit, designed to help 3d artists and content creators bring their creations to life.



at the start, we invisioned a world where species not only reproduce and require attention

but interact with avatars and each other, learn and play games, and add a dynamic never seen before in or outside of secondlife:

a self-sustaining, genetics-based eco system, that self-evolves and depends on other species to survive.



there are thousands of very talented artists, sculpters, and animators who face the dilema of adding functionality to their creations

yet do not have the resources or finances to hire a developer to complete their project

as a result, the market for scripted pets and other animals has been cornered by a handful of developers.

earning a profit, much less achieving their goal is for most a pipe dream.



seeing this, and being the freemarketeers we are [ yeah :) ], we set out to solve the problem. 

and in the process we've created an amazing platform that is simple to use and very easy to maintain

however, it's constrained by second life's script and http limitations, so in many ways, we've had to improvise



we've even created our own library of functions which we call "eco actions"

these "actions" allow creators to define how their breeds behave

and has since evolved into a full-featured programming language of it's own, based on custom events and pre-defined interactions



this goes well beyond customizing movement, animations, and menus within a single line of 'code'..

we implemented a variety of simple tools that give creators the ability to establish unique traits and behaviors that can be learned, manipulated, and passed on to offspring..

effectively creating a way for points to be earned and features to be unlocked without the mess of hundred of lines of code. 

all of this is defined by the creator, meaning that almost everything is customizable, extendable, and optional



the project has become a huge success, quickly being adopted by over 80 content creators in just a few months

yet we are far from done in our mission to be the most widely used toolkit in all secondlife-based virtual worlds



in order to acheive this, we intend to move this entire project into it's own viewer for possible integration into the official second life viewer and other 3rd party viewers.

initially, the viewer will be self-contained and downloadable for use with the most popular grids 

this viewer will be used to build and design eco breeds and will function much like most 3rd party viewers.

this means, the toolkit will come as a standard build option with visual aides geared towards even the most "script unsavvy" residents

we will add hundreds plug and play examples that can be instantly reproduced by any object at any time

and finally, we'll open source the project to make the toolkit available across all viewers



built in tools will give creators the ability to control and maintain a vast system of breeds from their viewer despite ownership

end users will also have tools to feed and play with their pets, buy food, toys, accessories.. monitor behaviors, receive alerts, and participate in games, work with other breeders, and even follow up on auctions.


further, web and phone apps will be developed and distributed, bringing the same functionality as found on our custom viewer to smartphones and personal websites and blogs.



currently, the code is built with LSL and PHP and is not free, we charge $60 USD (or 15,000 lindens) in order to cover operating expenses and to fund our servers

those who have already contributed to the project WILL be compensated AND encouraged to join our paid support team



we have dedicated over 3000 hours combined and we've covered all expenses out of pocket. 


the pride we have for our work far exceeds the return but our mission moving forward takes us into a different direction.

if we are able to change the way people create interactive objects in secondlife, we could see a future where linden labs, the creators of second life, adopt our system as part of their core functionality.


if you follow the current events in secondlife, you already know the lab is proactively designing smarter movement with their new pathfinding tools.

this is a step in the right direction, but hardly creates much more than a smarter movement and an overly complex assortment of controls.


what drives most people away from second life is the primitive nature of development. 

not only must one learn how to build, 

but to make it "do something" it takes countless hours of trial and error to learn and utilize second life's programming language



i have yet to cover extent of what can be done with our wonderful project and the potential that lays just out of reach

the funding goal for this kickstarter is far from arbitrary and very carefully itemized to ensure our success in moving forward.

we are a very frugal and fast paced team, but the challenges ahead of us are HUGE and the costs are VERY expensive.


after reaching our goal, we will begin the next big phase of our project..

which includes adding more servers to our cluster and immediately begin work on the design and development of the viewer and it's componants.

this will be the code presented to Linden Labs for potential integration and will require the help of a team of developers, promoters, and support staff as well as lawyers [yay lawyers] to get this done quickly and keep things running smoothly.



without the proper funding, these goals simply can not be acheived and the second life community may never be more than a market for those who can write code

since this is a community driven project, every contibution earns an honorable mention, but to waste money on silly shwag is beyond the scope of our frugal ideology

if we are able to complete this project under budget, we intend to return the favor to the kickstarter community by funding other promising talent


we will keep you updated as the fundraising moves forward, but our eco ambitions are on hold while we do freelance work to pay our bills.

[thank you for your interest], we hope our project impresses you!
