The action scripts can be configured for a variety of purposes including as a limited or public food source, breeding nest, home object, toy or game, with the ability to rebuild lost, missing, or hidden breeds. The number of interactions can be limited per Action, and breeds can be configured to ignore certain types of Actions. Additional functionality is defined using eco "methods" which are triggered by a series of "events" defined in the Actions list. Each event is a chance to give your breed unique interactions and functionality.'); ?>
