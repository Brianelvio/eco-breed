<p><strong>Server downtime scheduled for May 31st</strong><p>
<p>It is necessary to perform maintenance on the Takecopy server. The window for maintenance will be between May 31st, 2012 9:00 pm PST to June 1st, 2012 1:00 am PST. Your hosted services, including Takecopy vendors and Takecopy Ecos may experience up to 15 minutes of intermittent availability while we update the server.</p>

<p><strong> Eco Breeds 2.x release expected soon!</strong><p>
<p>Several performance enhancements and an improved website will be the highlights of the 2.x release. Most importantly, the fixes include some rare bugs that have caused some unexpected behaviors and a new forum for users to exchange ideas, help each other, ask questions, and share code.</p>

<p><strong>Eco support group closed.</strong><p>
<p>The owners of the group asked to shut it down after weeks of malicious attacks by a disgruntled customer and their alts. While im always in favor of letting people vent, i also side with the group owners for wanting to maintain a sane and pleasant work environment. New groups may be formed by members, but remember they are not an official support group, nor will one be created. Second life groups do not provide the tools neccessary to properly support the eco project. A forum will soon be added to the website to help document customer questions, ideas, and troubleshooting.</p>
