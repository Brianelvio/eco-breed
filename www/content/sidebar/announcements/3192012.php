Breed records are in READONLY mode, changes are being made on the breed profiles. Because of this, modifications to individual breeds is currently limited. Once i've completed posting the references this afternoon (a bit of a priority), the breed records will be serviced. I appreciate your patience while 1.x officially rolls out! -dev khaos
