<p>We are semi-AFK for the next week as we work to catch up on finances due to our extended development of 1.x. When we return, the future of the project will begin to unfold as open-hosting will be made available as well as the much anticipated series of videos and global controls. </p>

<p>Open hosting means anyone will be able to mirror the eco site on their own servers and host breed data locally rather than on takecopy servers. Changes in hosting allow you to bypass breed/species limits and can be effective immediately to existing breeds already in production. The value of hosting on our servers will be evident as the core requirements for open hosting demand not only bandwidth and available space, but the ability to set concurrency limits and the processing power to handle the requests.</p>

<p>The completion of this phase of the project will encourage further web development which is where much of the core algorithm is located. I'm aware that most of you don't precisely understand what i'm going on about, but in plain speak, you'll be able to have your eco and breed it too! The important part is open sourcing as much of the code as possible to make it enjoyable, practical, and useful for as wide an audience as possible. The extent of open sourcing will not overlap the authentication in order to protect it's value and my countless hours of late night coding. But the goal of this project has always been to provide the most customizable and interactive AI that second life has ever seen.</p>

<p>In the meantime, i will try really really hard to satisfy all support requests, you are defintely not bothering me and i hope there is no hard feelings as you have not been used to my
absence during the course of this project :)</p>
