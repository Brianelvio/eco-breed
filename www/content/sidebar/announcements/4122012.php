Several reports have been filed regarding offspring not connecting to an action object. Further testing uncovered a flaw with the filter() method. This occurs with multiple action objects and simultaneous requests, such as during birth. Additionally, other reports have indicated failed connections and births. These issues are being worked on and tested, a fix will be available soon but I'm currently unavailable to solve these issues, so the release may not be ready until 2.x. It is important that you continue to test your configurations, as each unique simulation presents a completely different outcome. If you experience these issues, please file a report with a way for me to replicate the issue. This will ensure we solve the problem completely and quickly. Thank you for your hard work and patience. -dev khaos
